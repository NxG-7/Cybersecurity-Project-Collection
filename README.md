# Cybersecurity-Project-Collection
This collection includes a variety of cybersecurity projects ranging from basic to advance.

This project collection has various tools and software to help improve cybersecurity measures. The tools provided include antivirus software, ARP spoofer, credit card encryption & decryption, facial authentication system, image encryption, image steganography system, keylogger, network scanner, network sniffer, Nmap scanner, password cracker, password generator, password strength tester, phishing, security scanner, SSH Bruteforce, text encryption and user authentication system.

>**Antivirus Software** - Provides protection from malicious viruses and malware.

>**ARP Spoofer** - Allows users to intercept data being sent between devices on a network.

>**Credit Card Encryption & Decryption** - Provides an extra layer of security for the financial information of users.

>**Facial Authentication System** - Uses facial recognition technology for user authentication and access control.

>**Image Encryption** - Provides encryption services for image files to prevent unauthorized access.

>**Image Steganography System** - Hides secret messages within images to prevent detection.

>**Keylogger** - Can be used to record keystrokes on a computer or device for monitoring purposes.

>**Network Scanner** - Scans for open ports and vulnerable services on a network.

>**Network Sniffer** - Monitors communications on a network to detect suspicious activity.

>**Nmap Scanner** - Maps a target network and identifies active hosts, ports and service running on them.

>**Password Cracker** - Uses brute force or dictionary attacks to crack passwords for unauthorized access.

>**Password Generator** - Creates strong passwords to increase overall security measures.

>**Password Strength Tester** - Tests the strength of passwords to ensure they are secure.

>**Phishing** - Helps detect and prevent phishing scams.

>**Security Scanner** - Scans for vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities in a system.

>**SSH Bruteforce** - Used to try and guess SSH passwords.

>**Text Encryption** - Provides encryption services for text to prevent unauthorized access.

>**User Authentication System** - Provides an authentication system for users to access protected areas.

All of the projects within this collection have been created to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process of protecting a computer system from digital threats. It is important to note that some of these tools may be used for nefarious reasons, and therefore should only be used in an ethical and responsible manner.
